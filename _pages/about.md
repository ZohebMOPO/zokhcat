17 y/o programmmer who likes to do things on web. I have been active on the programming space for 3 years now. I like sleeping. Check out [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn),[/r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/).

I am currently doing a research internship at IIITB with [Prof. S.K. Chakrabarti](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/sujit-kumar-chakrabarti) on building compiler systems. Umm, I wrote a book about building web apps!!! Check out, [Hypebeast](https://notionpress.com/read/hypebeast).

Lastly, you are an awesome person. I hope you have a good time with your friends. Everything will change the way you want it to. You deserve it all. CBSE sucks. I will have a mental breakdown if the servers for Spotify go down. Checkout his music covers at [ked.arx](https://www.instagram.com/ked.arx/).
